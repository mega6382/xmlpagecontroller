## History. ##
When i create another site, I was thinking about using in the following projects the library / framework to establish for themselves and to support projects created by me some rules that easily could modify the structure or content of the site without having to comb the source files might not even annotated in search of the key places where the made the changes.

It would also lead to overall structural follow-up projects.

The library operates on the principle of all in one, for this reason I believe that it is worthy of attention.
